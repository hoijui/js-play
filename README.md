# js-play

my musing with JavaScript as I learn the language.

## Ideas

- try writing my own Markdown parser

### quicktable.js

Build a simple JS library that builds on jQuery to quickly and easily
generate simple, bare-bones html tables based on 2D arrays of data. Existing
solutions (e.g. DataTables) are over-engineered and contain too many
features. I don't know of anything else that does this in a simple manner.
